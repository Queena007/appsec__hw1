#Documenting the existing bugs

1. crash1.gft
This creates segmentation fault
The segmentation fault is created due to an invalid location request
The involved file directs a number of bytes that leads to an underflow when processed.
Therefore, the The underlying issue stems from the program not properly 
validating input sizes, leading to unsafe memory operations.

2. crash2.gft
This results to the realization of undefined behavior
The input includes an invalid record type (`\xFF`) 
and an excessively large record size (`\x00\x00\x00\xFF`).
This results in upredictable outcome 

3. hang.gft
This results in the emergence of infinite loop
The file contains an invalid opcode (`\x00\x00\x00\x02`) 
that the `animate` function attempts to execute.
This prompts the program to continuously cycles without
